<h2>Privacy, Your Data & Terms<h2>


    <h3>Your Data</h3>

    <h4>Searches near a place</h4>
    <p>
    When you search for a course near an area, you can give a postcode, use the browser geolocation, or type in a place. What happens with your data depends on the format of that choice.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Postcodes: Postcodes are looked up and processed internally by the application.
    </p>

    <p>Browser geolocation: he latitude and longitude are processed internally by the application</p>

    <p>Place: If you type in a place, such as a neighbourhood or an address, the system will pass this data (and only that place text data) to <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro">Google Gecoding API</a> Service, to resolve this to a location </p>

    <h4>Routing</h4>

    <p>
    If you do a search for courses near an area, and view a course, the system passes this location (as latitude and longitude) to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701705.aspx">Bing Transit API</a> service.     </p>

    <h4>Data choices for location privacy</h4>
     <p>
    You have the choice to search for a nearby place or just a town or neighbourhood to keep your location more  private. For example you can just search for courses near "Beeston" instead of your home address. You also have the choice not to search for courses near a location.
